# CycleGAN Project

## Introduction
CycleGAN is a groundbreaking approach that enables the transformation of images from one domain to another without paired examples. This technique has vast applications, including but not limited to style transfer, photo enhancement, and in domains where paired training data is not available. Our implementation focuses on providing a user-friendly, highly customizable framework to explore the capabilities of CycleGAN in various domains.

## Installation
To use this CycleGAN implementation, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Botang-Liao/GAN-CycleGAN.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```
cd CycleGAN
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run a CycleGAN model with your data or our preconfigured datasets, use the following command:
```python
python main.py
```

You can monitor the training progress in TensorBoard by navigating to the logs directory created during training.

## Results
The trained models, along with their outputs, will be saved in the `results` directory. This includes transformation examples from both domains and the loss metrics over the training period.

-  the transformation shifted from horse to zebra, and then it repeated, moving from horse to zebra once again.
